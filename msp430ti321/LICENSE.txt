1. LICENSE GRANT  AND USE RESTRICTIONS.  Subject to  the terms of this
Agreement,  TI  hereby  grants  to you  the  following  non-exclusive,
non-transferable,   non-assignable,   fully   paid-up,   royalty-free,
non-sublicensable licenses  under all TI  intellectual property rights
embodied in the Licensed Materials:

  a. HOST  LICENSE.  You  may use the  Licensed Materials  to generate
     applications  ("Target  Applications")  that execute  solely  and
     exclusively on processing devices  manufactured by or for TI ("TI
     Devices").  For clarification, you may use the Licensed Materials
     on a single-user or multi-user host computer system.

  b. TARGET LICENSE.   The  Licensed Materials  may  include  software
     programs in an object  code format that are designed specifically
     for  use with  TI Devices  in Target  Applications  ("Object Code
     Licensed   Materials").   You  may   (i)  make   copies,  display
     internally, distribute  internally, test and  evaluate internally
     and use internally the Object Code Licensed Materials provided to
     you for  the sole purposes of  designing, developing, maintaining
     and  supporting Target  Applications, and  (ii) make,  use, sell,
     offer to sell, import, export and otherwise distribute the Object
     Code Licensed  Materials, solely as part  of Target Applications,
     provided that  such Target Applications are  in executable format
     only  that execute  solely and  exclusively on  TI  Devices.  The
     Licensed Materials may also include libraries and applications in
     source code form ("Source Code Licensed Materials").  You may (x)
     create  modified  or  derivative  programs of  such  Source  Code
     Licensed  Materials  and (y)  make,  use,  sell,  offer to  sell,
     import, export and  otherwise distribute executable only versions
     of  the  Source  Code  Licensed  Materials,  or  any  derivatives

     you may not distribute the Source Code Licensed Materials, or any
     derivatives  thereof,  under  any  circumstances in  source  code
     format.
	
  c. CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS.  The licenses granted to you hereunder
     shall include your on-site and off-site suppliers and independent
     contractors, while such suppliers and independent contractors are
     performing work  for or providing services to  you, provided that
     such   suppliers  and   independent  contractors   have  executed
     work-for-hire agreements with you containing terms and conditions
     not inconsistent with the terms  and conditions set forth is this
     Agreement,  and   provided  further   that  you  agree   you  are
     responsible  for the  breach of  this  Agreement by  any of  your
     suppliers or contractors to the  same extent that you would be if
     you breached the Agreement yourself.

  d. LIMITED  LICENSE to TI and  Covenant not to  Sue.  Continuing for
     the term of  this Agreement, you hereby grant to  TI under any of
     your   patents    embodied   in   the    Licensed   Materials   a
     non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-assignable, worldwide, fully
     paid-up, royalty-free license to  make, use, sell, offer to sell,
     import, export and  otherwise distribute such Licensed Materials.
     You  covenant not  to  sue or  otherwise  assert Derived  Patents
     against  TI  and  TI's  affiliates  and their  licensees  of  the
     Licensed Materials.   In the event  you assign a  Derived Patent,
     you shall require as a  condition of any such assignment that the
     assignee agree to be bound by the provisions in this Section 1(d)
     with respect to such Derived Patent.  Any attempted assignment or
     transfer  in violation  of this  Section 1(d)  shall be  null and
     void.  For  purposes of  this Agreement, "Derived  Patents" means
     any  of  your patents  issuing  from  a  patent application  that
     discloses  and claims  an  invention conceived  of  by you  after
     delivery of the Licensed Materials,  and derived by you from your
     access to the Licensed Materials.

  e. NO OTHER  LICENSE.   Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary,
     nothing in this Agreement shall  be construed as a license to any
     intellectual  property  rights  of  TI other  than  those  rights
     embodied in the Licensed Materials provided to you by TI.  EXCEPT
     AS  PROVIDED HEREIN,  NO OTHER  LICENSE, EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED, BY
     ESTOPPEL  OR OTHERWISE,  TO  ANY OTHER  TI INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY
     RIGHTS IS GRANTED HEREIN.

  f. RESTRICTIONS.  

      i. You shall not disclose or distribute the source code versions
         of the Licensed Materials,  or any derivative thereof, to any
         person other  than your  employees and contractors  whose job
         performance requires access.

     ii. Use of any  software application generated using the Licensed
         Materials  on processing  devices manufactured  by or  for an
         entity other than TI is  a material breach of this Agreement.
         Use  of  the Licensed  Materials  to  assist  in the  design,
         development or  verification of a device  not manufactured by
         or for TI is a material breach of this Agreement.  Use of the
         Licensed  Materials  to generate  applications  for use  with
         processing devices other than those manufactured by or for TI
         is a material breach of this Agreement.

    iii. You may  either  make one  copy of  the Source  Code Licensed
         Materials  for  archival purposes  or  copy  the Source  Code
         Licensed Materials  to another  medium and keep  the original
         Source Code Licensed  Materials for archival purposes.  Other
         than as expressly set forth  in this Section 1(f)(iii) and in
         Section 1(b)  above, you may not otherwise  copy or reproduce
         the Licensed Materials.

     iv. Except as otherwise provided  in this Agreement, you will not
         sublicense,  transfer, or  assign the  Licensed  Materials or
         your rights under this Agreement to any third party.

      v. You may use the  Licensed Materials with Open Source Software
         (as  defined below)  or  with software  developed using  Open
         Source Software (e.g. tools) provided you do not incorporate,
         combine or distribute the Licensed Materials in a manner that
         subjects the Licensed  Materials, or any derivatives thereof,
         to any license obligations or any other intellectual property
         related  terms of  such Open  Source Software.   "Open Source
         Software" means  any software licensed  under terms requiring
         that    (A)   other    software    ("Proprietary   Software")
         incorporated, combined  or distributed with  such software or
         developed   using  such   software:  (i)   be   disclosed  or
         distributed  in  source  code  form;  or  (ii)  otherwise  be
         licensed  on  terms  inconsistent  with  the  terms  of  this
         Agreement, including but not limited to permitting use of the
         Proprietary  Software  on  or  with  devices  other  than  TI
         Devices, or (B) require  the owner of Proprietary Software to
         license  any of  its  patents  to users  of  the Open  Source
         Software  and/or Proprietary Software  incorporated, combined
         or distributed  with such  Open Source Software  or developed
         using such Open Source Software.

  h. TERMINATION.  This Agreement  is effective until terminated.  You
     may terminate this Agreement at any time by written notice to TI.
     Without prejudice to any other rights, if you fail to comply with
     the terms of  this Agreement, TI may terminate  your right to use
     the  Licensed  Materials,  or  any derivative  thereof,  and  any
     applications  generated  using  the  Licensed Materials,  or  any
     derivative thereof, upon written notice to you.  Upon termination
     of this  Agreement, you  will destroy any  and all copies  of the
     Licensed  Materials, including any  derivatives thereof,  in your
     possession,  custody  or control  and  provide  to  TI a  written
     statement  signed by  your  authorized representative  certifying
     such  destruction. Except  for  Sections 1(a)  and  1(b) and  the
     covenant not to sue set  forth in Section 1(d), all provisions of
     this Agreement shall survive termination of the Agreement.

2. LICENSED MATERIALS OWNERSHIP.  The Licensed Materials are licensed,
not sold to you, and can only  be used in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.   Subject to the  licenses granted to you  pursuant to
this Agreement,  TI and TI's licensors  own and shall  continue to own
all  right, title,  and interest  in  and to  the Licensed  Materials,
including  all copies  thereof.   The parties  agree  that all  fixes,
modifications and improvements to  the Licensed Materials conceived of
or made  by TI that  are based,  either in whole  or in part,  on your
feedback, suggestions or recommendations are the exclusive property of
TI  and  all  right,  title   and  interest  in  and  to  such  fixes,
modifications  or improvements  to  the Licensed  Materials will  vest
solely  in TI.   You  acknowledge  and agree  that  regardless of  the
changes made to the Licensed Materials,  your right to use any and all
derivatives  of the  Licensed Materials  shall remain  subject  to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Moreover, you acknowledge and
agree  that when  your  independently developed  software or  hardware
components  are combined,  in  whole  or in  part,  with the  Licensed
Materials, or any  derivative thereof, your right to  use the Licensed
Materials,  or  any derivative  thereof,  embodied  in such  resulting
combined work shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.
	 
3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.  

  a. THE  LICENSED  MATERIALS  contain  copyrighted   material,  trade
     secrets and other proprietary information of TI and its licensors
     and  are  protected by  copyright  laws, international  copyright
     treaties, and  trade secret laws,  as well as  other intellectual
     property laws.  To protect TI's  and its licensors' rights in the
     Licensed Materials,  you agree, except  as specifically permitted
     by statute by a provision  that cannot be waived by contract, not
     to   "unlock",  decompile,   reverse  engineer,   disassemble  or
     otherwise  translate  any  portions  of  the  Licensed  Materials
     provided to you in object code format only to a human-perceivable
     form nor to permit any person  or entity to do so.  You shall not
     remove,   erase,   alter,   tamper,   cover,   or   obscure   any
     confidentiality, trade secret, proprietary, or copyright notices,
     trade-marks, proprietary,  patent, or other  identifying marks or
     designs printed or stamped on, affixed to, or encoded or recorded
     in  any  component  of  the  Licensed  Materials  and  you  shall
     reproduce and include in all copies of the Licensed Materials the
     copyright  notice(s)  and proprietary  legend(s)  of  TI and  its
     licensors as they appear  in the Licensed Materials.  TI reserves
     all rights not specifically granted under this Agreement.

  b. CERTAIN  LICENSED MATERIALS may  be based on  industry recognized
     standards or  software programs published  by industry recognized
     standards  bodies and  certain  third parties  may  claim to  own
     patents, copyrights, and  other intellectual property rights that
     cover  implementation of  those standards.   You  acknowledge and
     agree that this  Agreement does not convey a  license to any such
     third party patents,  copyrights, and other intellectual property
     rights  and  that you  are  solely  responsible  for any  patent,
     copyright,  or  other  intellectual  property  right  claim  that
     relates to your use or distribution of the Licensed Materials, or
     your  use  or  distribution  of  your products  that  include  or
     incorporate  the Licensed  Materials.  Moreover,  you acknowledge
     that any fees or royalties paid to TI pursuant to this Agreement,
     as applicable, do  not include any fees or  royalties that may be
     payable to any third party  based on such third party's interests
     in  the Licensed  Materials or  any intellectual  property rights
     that  cover implementation of  any industry  recognized standard,
     any  software  program   published  by  any  industry  recognized
     standards bodies or any other proprietary technology.

4. AUDIT  RIGHT.  At TI's request,  and within thirty  (30) days after
receiving  written notice,  you  shall permit  an independent  auditor
selected by  TI to have access,  no more than once  each calendar year
(unless  the immediately  preceding audit  revealed a  breach  of this
Agreement)  and during  your regular  business hours,  to all  of your
equipment, records,  and documents as may  contain information bearing
upon  the  use  of  the  Licensed Materials.   You  shall  keep  full,
complete, clear and accurate records with respect to product sales and
distributions for  a period  beginning with the  then-current calendar
year and going back three (3) years.

5.  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION.  You  acknowledge  and  agree that  the
Licensed Materials, and any  derivative thereof, contain trade secrets
and other confidential information of TI and its licensors.  You agree
to  use the  Licensed  Materials, or  any  derivative thereof,  solely
within the  scope of  the licenses set  forth herein, to  maintain the
Licensed Materials,  or any derivative thereof,  in strict confidence,
to use at least the same procedures and degree of care that you use to
prevent  disclosure  of  your  own confidential  information  of  like
importance  but in  no  instance  less than  reasonable  care, and  to
prevent  disclosure  of  the  Licensed Materials,  or  any  derivative
thereof, to any  third party, except as may  be necessary and required
in connection  with your rights and obligations  hereunder.  You agree
to obtain executed confidentiality  agreements with your employees and
contractors having access to the Licensed Materials, or any derivative
thereof, and  to diligently take  steps to enforce such  agreements in
this respect.   TI agrees that  the employment agreements used  in the
normal course of your business  shall satisfy the requirements of this
section. TI  may disclose your contact information  to TI's applicable
licensors.

6. Warranties  and Limitations.   THE LICENSED MATERIALS  ARE PROVIDED
"AS  IS".  TI  MAKES NO  WARRANTY OR  REPRESENTATION,  EITHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, REGARDING  THE LICENSED MATERIALS, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED  TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR  A  PARTICULAR PURPOSE  OR  NON-INFRINGEMENT  OF  ANY THIRD  PARTY
PATENTS,  COPYRIGHTS,  TRADE SECRETS  OR  OTHER INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY
RIGHTS.  YOU AGREE TO USE YOUR INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT IN DEVELOPING YOUR
PRODUCTS AND DERIVATIVES OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS.  NOTHING CONTAINED
IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE CONSTRUED AS A WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION BY
TI  TO MAINTAIN  PRODUCTION OF  ANY TI  SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE  OR OTHER
HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE WITH WHICH THE LICENSED MATERIALS MAY BE USED.

YOU  ACKNOWLEDGE AND  AGREE THAT  THE  LICENSED MATERIALS  MAY NOT  BE
INTENDED  FOR PRODUCTION APPLICATIONS  AND MAY  CONTAIN IRREGULARITIES
AND  DEFECTS  NOT  FOUND  IN PRODUCTION  SOFTWARE.   FURTHERMORE,  YOU
ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE LICENSED MATERIALS HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED
OR  CERTIFIED   BY  ANY  GOVERNMENT  AGENCY   OR  INDUSTRY  REGULATORY
ORGANIZATION OR  ANY OTHER THIRD  PARTY ORGANIZATION.  YOU  AGREE THAT
PRIOR TO  USING, INCORPORATING OR DISTRIBUTING  THE LICENSED MATERIALS
IN OR  WITH ANY COMMERCIAL PRODUCT  THAT YOU WILL  THOROUGHLY TEST THE
PRODUCT AND  THE FUNCTIONALITY  OF THE LICENSED  MATERIALS IN  OR WITH
THAT PRODUCT AND BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR FAILURES.

IN NO  EVENT SHALL TI, OR  ANY APPLICABLE LICENSOR, BE  LIABLE FOR ANY
SPECIAL,  INDIRECT,  INCIDENTAL,  PUNITIVE OR  CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES,
HOWEVER  CAUSED, ON  ANY THEORY  OF LIABILITY,  IN CONNECTION  WITH OR
ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS, OR
ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF,  REGARDLESS OF WHETHER TI HAS  BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY  OF SUCH DAMAGES.   EXCLUDED DAMAGES INCLUDE,  BUT ARE
NOT LIMITED  TO, COST OF  REMOVAL OR REINSTALLATION,  OUTSIDE COMPUTER
TIME, LABOR  COSTS, LOSS OF DATA,  LOSS OF GOODWILL,  LOSS OF PROFITS,
LOSS OF  SAVINGS, OR LOSS OF  USE OR INTERRUPTION OF  BUSINESS.  IN NO
EVENT WILL  TI'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY  UNDER THIS AGREEMENT  OR ARISING
OUT OF YOUR USE OF  THE LICENSED MATERIALS, OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF,
EXCEED THE GREATER  OF FIVE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS  (US$500) OR THE FEES
PAID TO TI BY YOU FOR THE LICENSED MATERIALS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental  or consequential  damages  or limitation  on  how long  an
implied warranty  lasts, the above  limitations or exclusions  may not
apply to you.

7.  Indemnification Disclaimer.   YOU  ACKNOWLEDGE AND  AGREE THAT  TI
SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR AND  SHALL NOT DEFEND OR INDEMNIFY YOU AGAINST
ANY THIRD PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIM THAT RELATES TO OR IS BASED ON YOUR
MANUFACTURE, USE,  OR DISTRIBUTION OF  THE LICENSED MATERIALS,  OR ANY
DERIVATIVE THEREOF,  OR YOUR MANUFACTURE,  USE, OFFER FOR  SALE, SALE,
IMPORTATION  OR   DISTRIBUTION  OF  YOUR  PRODUCTS   THAT  INCLUDE  OR
INCORPORATE THE LICENSED MATERIALS, OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF.

obligation to install, maintain  or support the Licensed Materials, or
any derivatives thereof.

representation or warranty  regarding the proper export classification
for such software or whether  an export license or other documentation
is required for the exportation of such software.

11. GOVERNING  LAW AND SEVERABILITY.  This Agreement  will be governed
by and interpreted in accordance with  the laws of the State of Texas,
without reference to conflict of laws principles.  If for any reason a
court of  competent jurisdiction finds any provision  of the Agreement
to be  unenforceable, that provision  will be enforced to  the maximum
extent  possible to  effectuate the  intent  of the  parties, and  the
remainder of  the Agreement shall  continue in full force  and effect.
